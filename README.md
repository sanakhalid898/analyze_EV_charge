# analyze_EV_charge
As electronic vehicles (EVs) become more popular, there is an increasing need for access to charging stations, also known as ports. To that end, many modern apartment buildings have begun retrofitting their parking garages to include shared charging stations. A charging station is shared if it is accessible by anyone in the building.

EV Charging
But with increasing demand comes competition for these ports — nothing is more frustrating than coming home to find no charging stations available! In this project, we used a dataset to help apartment building managers better understand their tenants’ EV charging habits.
